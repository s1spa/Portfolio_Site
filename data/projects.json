        "uk": "ZeroTip — це інді-гра, створена всього за 3 дні під час гейм-джему.\nТема джему — “Loop” (петля), і команда реалізувала її через механіку перемотки часу.\n\nУ грі представлено два рівні:\n\n🎓 Tutorial — навчальний рівень, де гравець опановує основні механіки;\n\n🚀 Основний рівень — повноцінна місія, що вимагає концентрації, реакції й терпіння. Вона складна, але саме це розпалює азарт і змушує спробувати знову.\n\nСюжет переносить нас у 3077 рік. Світ лежить у руїнах, цивілізація зникла, але доставка — святе.\nВи — останній кур’єр служби Glovo, що мчить крізь мертвий космос, доставляючи піцу єдиному вижилому клієнту.\nНа шляху — зоряні бурі, уламки планет і викривлення часу.\nАле цього разу щось пішло не так...\n\nМеханіки, які розкривають тему Loop:\n\n⏪ Перемотка часу — повернення у ключові моменти, щоб виправити помилки.\n\n✨ Телепорт — миттєве переміщення, яке відкриває нові шляхи.\n\n🧊 Тіні минулих дій — заморожені копії себе, що допомагають пройти перешкоди, створюючи унікальну часову стратегію.\n\nZeroTip — це гра про нескінченні спроби, часові парадокси й віру в те, що навіть у найтемнішу мить доставка все одно має відбутися. 🚴‍♂️🍕💫\n\nНаша команда:\n👨‍💻 Чекалюк Діма — програміст\n👨‍💻 Авдосьєв Ілля — програміст\n🎨 Кідін Вова — 3D-дизайнер",
